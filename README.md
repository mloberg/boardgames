# Board Games

Picking a board game to play can be challenging. Figuring out what games work
with the number of people you have is difficult enough, but then factor in how
much time and brain space you have. Often picking the game ends up being the most
difficult part of the night.

This grabs my collection from [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) and
provides a web page to filter and search for board games.
